h1. ZeroShell (ZRSh)

h2. Introduction

ZeroShell is my implementation of a simple shell. However, it'll not focus on making it a useful shell. It's only coded for practicing and for the Operating System homework.

ZeroShell is also an open source software, under the MIT license.

h2. Library dependencies

ZRSh currently requires libreadline to work.

h2. Compatibility

ZRSh is known to compile and run on Linux(ArchLinux) and Mac OSX.
